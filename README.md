HI everyone. i have tried to automate most things for installing arch.<br />
using this script you just need to do a few stuff to install arch.<br />
i have adopted some parts of this script with a few changes i made on them.<br />
Thanks to those people.<br />

You just need to do the following:<br />
* first run the **Install-Automator**<br />
* then run the **Auto_chroot**<br />
